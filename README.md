This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Setup

1. Then copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env.local In this file you have to add your database connection information.
2. Then setup your application environment.
3. Go to the project dir and run this command "npm i".
    "npm i" This installs all dependencies. So after that your development environment is ready to use.
4. Go to the project dir and run this command "npm run dev".
5. Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
